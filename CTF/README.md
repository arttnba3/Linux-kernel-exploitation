# CTF Challenges with exploitation code

Here's my own collection of some kernel pwn challenges in some CTFs.

Note that most of the filesystem in challenges have been repacked by me for tons of times, so they may not be the same as the original ones.

Note that you need to repack the binary file of exploitation filesystem by yourselves if you'd like to do these challenges :)
